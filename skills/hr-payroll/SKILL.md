| Allowances breakdown | optional | optional | — | e.g. transport: 200 |
| Probation (months) | Default: 0 (none) | optional | ❌ | Ask if different |

### 2. Get Next Employee ID
```python
import sqlite3, os
DB = os.path.expanduser("~/hr.db")
conn = sqlite3.connect(DB)
c = conn.cursor()
year = 2026  # use current year
c.execute("UPDATE emp_sequence SET last_no = last_no + 1 WHERE year = ?", (year,))
c.execute("SELECT last_no FROM emp_sequence WHERE year = ?", (year,))
n = c.fetchone()[0]
conn.commit(); conn.close()
emp_id = f"ATU-EMP-{year}-{n:04d}"
```

### 3. Insert into DB
```python
import json
conn = sqlite3.connect(DB)
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute("""
INSERT INTO employees
  (emp_id, full_name, nric, nationality, address, email, tel,
   position, department, employment_type, start_date, end_date,
   probation_months, basic_salary, allowances)
VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
""", (emp_id, full_name, nric, nationality, address, email, tel,
      position, department, employment_type, start_date, end_date,
      probation_months, basic_salary, json.dumps(allowances) if allowances else None))
conn.commit(); conn.close()
```

### 4. Generate Contract PDF
```bash
~/.local/bin/uv run --with reportlab python3 \
  ~/Agent_K_Telegram/skills/hr-payroll/scripts/build_contract.py ATU-EMP-YYYY-XXXX
```
- Saved to: `~/Documents/AiTraining2U/HR/Contracts/{YYYY}/Unsigned/{emp_id}_{Name}_{Type}-Contract_{date}.pdf`
- DB `contract_pdf` field auto-updated by the script

### 5. Deliver for Review
- Send PDF to the channel the user is interacting from:
  - User in **Telegram group** → group `$TELEGRAM_GROUP_CHAT_ID`
  - User in **Telegram DM or Claude Code / terminal** → DM `$TELEGRAM_DM_CHAT_ID`
- Caption:
  - Employee name, position, contract type, start date, salary/allowance
- Then ask: **"Please review the contract. Reply 'send to employee', 'ok go ahead', or 'email it' to send."**
- **NEVER email without explicit user approval**

### 6. Email Contract to Employee
ONLY after explicit approval:
- **To:** employee email
- **CC (always):** recipients from `$CC_EMAILS` (comma-separated)
- **Subject:** `Employment Contract – {Position} | AiTraining2U PLT`
- **Attachment:** unsigned PDF
- **Body:** Professional HTML email (dark blue header, same style as invoice) covering:
  - Congratulations / welcome tone
  - Key terms summary (position, start date, salary)
  - Instruction to sign and return
  - Sign-off: `$COMPANY_CONTACT_NAME`, `$COMPANY_NAME`, `$COMPANY_EMAIL`
- **ALWAYS send via the custom script** (NOT Gmail MCP — MCP strips the display name from From header):
  ```bash
  ~/.local/bin/uv run --with google-api-python-client --with google-auth \
    python3 ~/Agent_K_Telegram/skills/send-email/scripts/send_email.py \
    --to EMPLOYEE_EMAIL \
    --cc $CC_EMAILS \
    --subject "SUBJECT" \
    --attach PATH_TO_PDF \
    --html 'HTML_BODY_STRING'
  ```
  This ensures the From header shows: **Atlas (AiTraining2U) &lt;atlas.aitraining2u@gmail.com&gt;**

### 7. Store Signed Contract
When user sends back the signed PDF:
1. Save to `~/Documents/AiTraining2U/HR/Contracts/{YYYY}/Signed/{emp_id}_{Name}_{Type}-Contract_{date}_SIGNED.pdf`
2. Update DB: `UPDATE employees SET signed_pdf=? WHERE emp_id=?`
3. Confirm to user: "Signed contract stored at [path]"

---

## File Storage
```
~/Documents/AiTraining2U/HR/Contracts/
└── {YYYY}/
    ├── Unsigned/   ← generated contracts
    └── Signed/     ← signed copies returned by employee
```

**File naming:**
- Unsigned: `ATU-EMP-2026-0001_John-Smith_Full-Time-Contract_2026-03-01.pdf`
- Signed:   `ATU-EMP-2026-0001_John-Smith_Full-Time-Contract_2026-03-01_SIGNED.pdf`

**File hygiene:**
- Never save to `~/` root
- Regeneration overwrites the unsigned copy in place
- Only one unsigned + one signed copy per employee

---

## Database — `~/hr.db`
- Tables: `employees`, `emp_sequence`
- Setup script: `~/Agent_K_Telegram/skills/hr-payroll/scripts/setup_db.py` (run once if DB missing)
- Employee ID format: `ATU-EMP-YYYY-XXXX`
